    "Let's now take a break from the flow of the program, and talk about a core property of several data types in Python: **indexing**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Indexing is a way of assigning order to elements in some container. \n",
    "**Containers** are objects that can contain an arbitrary number of other objects within themselves.\n",
    "So far, we have encountered one instance of a container data type: strings.\n",
    "Strings are containers, because they can consist of any numbers of characters. \n",

    "\n",
    "As a notational peculiarity, indexing starts from $0$, and a symbol on the position $n$ can be accessed as ``string[n]``."
