    "\n",
    "This notebook covers the notion of a `class` and introduces the notion of **object-oriented programming** (OOP) in contrast to the **functional** programming approach we have implicitly used so far. As for Python-specific concepts, this notebook exemplifies how to define a new class, its attributes, and its methods. We also discuss inheritance."

    "**Programming paradigms** are ways to classify programming languages based on the way they allow you to structure your program.\n",
    "So far, we have treated Python as a _functional_ programming language.\n",
    "Roughly speaking, **functional** programming implements the _actions,_ or functions, that map some input to some output.\n",
    "It is a procedural approach organized around functions, flows, and code blocks.\n",
    "However, Python also allows for an **Object-oriented** programming appoach.\n",
    "**Object-oriented** programming has objects as its core, not just as a way to define data structures, but for the overall structure of the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Intuitively the difference between the two is between a focus on the functions/procedures vs. a focus on the properties of objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is concerned with introducing you to the main functionality of OOP. Note though that, since this is essentially a paradigm shift, familiarity with it requires practice.\n",
